She holds a white mug in her left hand and occasionally gestures with her right hand, sometimes resting her chin on it. In the foreground, there's a stainless steel pan with murky liquid on an induction cooktop, a gold-colored kitchen faucet, a black spray bottle, and other kitchen items. The background shows a dining area with a wooden table and chairs, and a living room with a television mounted on the wall and a green sofa.",
