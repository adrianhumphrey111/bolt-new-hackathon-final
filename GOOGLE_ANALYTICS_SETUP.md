# Google Analytics 4 Setup Guide

## Overview

I've implemented comprehensive Google Analytics 4 tracking for your video editing platform. The implementation tracks user behavior, video processing performance, AI feature usage, conversion events, and business metrics.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Google Analytics 4 Property

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Click "Create Account" or use existing account
3. Create a new property:
   - Property name: "Tailored Labs Video Editor"
   - Reporting time zone: Your timezone
   - Currency: USD
4. Choose "Web" platform
5. Enter your website URL (e.g., `https://tailorlabsai.com`)
6. Copy your **Measurement ID** (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

### 2. Configure Environment Variable

1. Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```
Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID.

### 3. Verify Implementation

1. Add the test component temporarily to your layout (development only):
```tsx
// In src/app/layout.tsx (remove after testing)
import { AnalyticsTest } from '../components/AnalyticsTest';

// Add <AnalyticsTest /> inside your layout
```

2. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser developer tools ‚Üí Console
4. Click test buttons to verify events are being sent
5. Check Google Analytics Real-time reports

### 4. Enable Debug Mode (Optional)

For detailed debugging, add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_DEBUG=true
```

## What's Being Tracked

### üîê User Authentication
- Sign up events (email, Google, GitHub)
- Login events  
- User session duration

### üé¨ Video Processing
- Video upload success/failure rates
- File size and format distribution
- Processing completion times
- Error tracking for failed uploads/processing

### ü§ñ AI Features
- AI chat interactions by type (content discovery vs removal)
- Content clip additions to timeline
- Content removal suggestion acceptance rates
- AI feature adoption metrics

### ‚ö° Timeline Editing
- Timeline operations (add, move, trim clips)
- Timeline performance metrics
- Session duration and engagement

### üí∞ Business Metrics
- Paywall interactions (shown, upgrade clicked, dismissed)
- Project creation events
- Feature discovery patterns
- Conversion funnel analysis

### üìä Performance Monitoring
- Page load times
- Video processing queue lengths
- Error rates by feature
- User drop-off points

## Key Events Reference

### Core Events
- `sign_up` - User registration
- `login` - User authentication
- `project_created` - New project creation
- `video_upload` - Video file uploads
- `video_processing_complete` - Processing completion

### AI Feature Events
- `ai_chat_interaction` - AI assistant usage
- `content_removal_suggestion` - AI content removal
- `timeline_operation` - Timeline modifications

### Business Events
- `paywall_interaction` - Upgrade prompts
- `video_export` - Video rendering/export
- `feature_discovered` - Feature adoption

## Dashboard Setup Recommendations

### 1. Create Custom Dashboards

**User Engagement Dashboard:**
- Daily/Monthly Active Users
- Session duration trends
- Feature adoption rates
- User retention cohorts

**Video Processing Dashboard:**
- Upload success rates
- Processing time distribution
- Error rate trends
- Queue performance metrics

**AI Features Dashboard:**
- AI interaction frequency
- Content discovery success rates
- Removal suggestion acceptance
- Feature conversion rates

**Business Intelligence Dashboard:**
- Conversion funnel analysis
- Revenue attribution
- Feature ROI analysis
- User segmentation insights

### 2. Set Up Conversions

Mark these events as conversions in GA4:
- `sign_up` - User registration
- `project_created` - Project creation
- `video_export` - Successful video export
- `purchase` - Subscription/credit purchases

### 3. Create Audiences

**High-Value Users:**
- Users who export videos
- Users who use AI features
- Users with multiple projects

**At-Risk Users:**
- Users who hit paywalls but don't convert
- Users with failed video uploads
- Users with short session durations

## Privacy & Compliance

### Data Collection
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is tracked
- User IDs are hashed for privacy
- Video content is not tracked, only metadata
- GDPR/CCPA compliant implementation

### User Consent
The implementation respects user privacy:
- Analytics only load after user interaction
- No tracking of unAuthenticated users' content
- Option to opt-out available

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Measurement ID is correct
3. Ensure environment variable is set
4. Check GA4 DebugView for real-time events

### Development Testing
1. Use the `AnalyticsTest` component for manual testing
2. Enable debug mode for detailed logging
3. Check Real-time reports in GA4
4. Verify events in browser Network tab

### Performance Considerations
- Analytics scripts load asynchronously
- Minimal impact on page load times
- Events are batched for efficiency
- Graceful degradation if GA4 is blocked

## Next Steps

1. **Set up the GA4 property and add the Measurement ID**
2. **Test the implementation using the debug component**
3. **Create custom dashboards for your specific KPIs**
4. **Set up automated reports for regular monitoring**
5. **Configure alerts for critical metrics (high error rates, low conversion)**
