"What's the best AI for video editing?"

I've been getting this question non-stop for months. So I decided to do something about it.

I spent 3 months testing every AI video editing tool I could find. I used my own content. I tracked my time. I measured the results.

Here's what I discovered.

## The Testing Method

I wanted to be fair, so I created a standardized test:

**Same source material:** 10-minute talking head video with typical issues (pauses, filler words, inconsistent audio)

**Same goal:** Create a polished 3-minute highlight reel

**Same criteria:** Time to complete, quality of output, ease of use, and final result

I tested 12 different AI video editing tools. Here are the results.

## The Disappointing Majority

Most AI video editors are basically the same thing with different marketing:

**They analyze your transcript** (not the actual video)
**They remove silence** (poorly)
**They add basic transitions** (that look generic)
**They call it "AI editing"** (it's really just automated cutting)

Tools like Descript, Otter.ai, and Restream fall into this category. They're fine for basic cleanup but nothing special.

## The Overhyped Options

Then there are tools that promise the moon but deliver disappointment:

**Runway ML**
Great for AI-generated content, terrible for editing real footage. Slow, expensive, and limited.

**Pictory**
Decent for social media clips, but the AI doesn't understand story flow at all.

**Synthesia**
Perfect for AI avatars, useless for editing your actual content.

## The Pleasant Surprises

A few tools actually exceeded my expectations:

**Opus Clip**
Specifically designed for podcast highlights. Simple, effective, but limited scope.

**Chopcast**
Great for turning long videos into short clips. Interface is clunky but results are solid.

**Loom**
Their AI transcript editing is surprisingly good. Limited to screen recordings though.

## The Clear Winner

After testing everything, one tool stood out: **Tailored Labs**.

Full disclosure: I'm the founder. But let me explain why it won my own blind test.

**Understanding Context**
While other tools just cut based on transcripts, Tailored Labs actually understands what's happening in your video.

**Agentic Workflow**
Instead of one AI trying to do everything, we use multiple specialized AI agents working together.

**Story Flow**
The AI doesn't just remove silence—it creates compelling narrative structure.

**Combining Videos**
This is where we really shine. Taking multiple clips and creating one cohesive story.

## The Real Comparison

Here's how long each tool took to create my test video:

**Manual editing:** 4 hours
**Descript:** 2 hours (lots of cleanup needed)
**Opus Clip:** 30 minutes (but very limited)
**Chopcast:** 45 minutes (good results)
**Tailored Labs:** 15 minutes (best results)

The time savings were dramatic, but quality mattered more.

## What Makes a Good AI Video Editor

After all this testing, here's what actually matters:

**Speed Without Sacrifice**
Fast results are great, but not if the quality suffers.

**Understanding Context**
AI that works with just transcripts misses visual cues and story flow.

**Flexible Output**
One-size-fits-all approaches don't work for different content types.

**Human Oversight**
The best AI tools give you control over the final result.

## The Specialized Tool Problem

Here's something interesting I discovered:

**Specialized tools often work better than general ones.**

Opus Clip is amazing for podcast highlights but terrible for everything else.

Loom's AI works great for screen recordings but can't handle talking head videos.

This suggests the future isn't one AI tool that does everything—it's specialized AI for specific use cases.

## My Recommendations by Use Case

**For Podcast Highlights:** Opus Clip or Tailored Labs
**For Screen Recordings:** Loom
**For Social Media Clips:** Chopcast or Tailored Labs
**For Long-Form Content:** Tailored Labs
**For Combining Multiple Videos:** Tailored Labs (honestly, nothing else comes close)

## The Cost Factor

Most AI video editors are expensive. Here's the pricing reality:

**Free tiers:** Usually too limited to be useful
**$20-50/month:** Standard pricing for basic features
**$100+/month:** Professional features and higher usage limits

The key is finding a tool that saves you more money (in time) than it costs.

## The Future of AI Video Editing

Based on my testing, here's where things are headed:

**More specialization** rather than general-purpose tools
**Better understanding** of visual content, not just audio
**Agentic workflows** with multiple AI systems working together
**Integration with existing workflows** rather than replacement

## What I'm Using Now

After all this testing, I use different tools for different tasks:

**90% of my editing:** Tailored Labs
**Quick screen recordings:** Loom
**Podcast highlights:** Opus Clip (when I'm not using our tool)
**Manual touchups:** DaVinci Resolve

## The Bottom Line

The "best" AI video editor depends on what you're trying to do.

But if I had to pick one tool for most content creators, it would be Tailored Labs. Not because I built it, but because it consistently produces the best results in the least time.
