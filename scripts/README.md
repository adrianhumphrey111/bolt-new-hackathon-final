# Personalized Email Campaign Script

This script generates personalized emails for all Tailored Labs users based on their activity level and engagement.

## Features

- **Smart User Categorization**: Automatically categorizes users based on activity:
  - `new_user` - Signed up but no projects
  - `project_creator` - Created projects but no videos  
  - `video_uploader` - Uploaded videos but no active editing
  - `timeline_editor` - Actively editing but hasn't used AI
  - `ai_user` - Power user using AI features
  - `active_user` - General active user

- **Personalized Content**: Each email is tailored to the user's specific journey and needs
- **Activity Metrics**: Tracks projects, videos, AI usage, timeline activity
- **CSV Export**: Generates ready-to-import CSV for email services

## Usage

### Generate CSV for Email Campaign
```bash
npm run email:csv
```
This creates a file like `personalized-emails-2025-01-02.csv` with all user data and personalized content.

```
This shows what the emails will look like without generating a file.
